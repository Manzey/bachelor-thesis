# Colorify

## About me
Hello guys and gals!

I am a 24 year old guy from Sweden that's currently studying Computer Science. For my bachelor thesis I've been investigating and trying to solve some issues that might arise for color blind programmers. Especially when they are working with designing of applications.

For the thesis I created a tool that can assist colorblind people, but mainly focused on developers! The tool includes some features to grab a color from the screen and receive information about it. (RGB, HEX and a readable, understandable color name). Also functionality for generating color schemes and previewing them in a mocked up application!

## The tool

Colorify is an assistance tool ment to help colorblind developers when working with colors.  
It includes functionality for:
* Eye dropper
* Gradient Color Palette
* RGB / HEX to color name
* Generation of color scheme based on entry color
* Ability to click on generated colors for additional information about each specific color

Currently only basic color scheme generation is implemented as it is in a beta stage, more will be added for the future.

The only dependencies the application have is that you have Java installed on your computer.
I used JRE 1.8 for compiling so that would be the prefered Java version to use.
The application is a JavaFX application so you need JavaFX aswell. (If it for some reason isn't included in your Java version)

This tool was created for a bachelor thesis in computer science and is ment to serve as assistance for developers that have any type of color vision deficiency.
With this tool I hope to allow colorblind developers to be able to work with colors and that it increases their confidence in their ability when designing applications.

### Images of the application

#### Entry-point
This is the entry point of the application, it includes functionality for grabbing a color, making it easily accessible right away.

#### Schemes
This is the schemes tab. Here you can generate schemes, you can click the colors generated to get info about them, you can preview the scheme as well as use a color palette to get readable names of a color.
